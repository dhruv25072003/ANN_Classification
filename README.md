🔮 ANN Classification

This repo showcases two ANN projects using TensorFlow/Keras:

📌 Projects

1️⃣ Customer Churn Prediction
	•	Predicts if a customer will leave.
	•	Preprocessing (encoding, scaling) + trained ANN.
	•	Streamlit app for real-time predictions.

2️⃣ Salary Prediction (Regression)
	•	Predicts salary based on experience/level.
	•	ANN regression model with training + inference scripts.

🚀 Highlights
	•	Hands-on ANN for classification & regression.
	•	End-to-end pipeline: preprocessing → training → deployment.
	•	Interactive Streamlit app for non-technical users.

▶️ Run

pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py   # for churn prediction
python salary_predictor.py   # for predicting salary.
