üîÆ ANN Classification Projects

This repository contains two beginner-to-intermediate level Artificial Neural Network (ANN) projects built using TensorFlow/Keras ‚Äî one for Customer Churn Prediction and another for Salary Prediction. Both include preprocessing, training, and deployment-ready code.

üìå Projects Included

1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Churn Prediction

Predicts whether a customer is likely to leave a company based on historical data.

Features:
	‚Ä¢	Trained on Churn_Modelling.csv.
	‚Ä¢	Preprocessing: Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Feature Scaling.
	‚Ä¢	ANN built using Keras Sequential API.
	‚Ä¢	Saved model (model.keras) + scaler/encoders for reproducibility.
	‚Ä¢	Interactive Streamlit app (app.py) to test customer details and get real-time churn prediction.

Run it locally:

pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py


‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Salary Prediction (Regression)

Predicts employee salary based on features like experience and level.

Features:
	‚Ä¢	Implemented in salary_regression.ipynb and salary_predictor.py.
	‚Ä¢	Regression-based ANN (instead of classification).
	‚Ä¢	Demonstrates how ANNs can adapt to continuous value prediction.
	‚Ä¢	Includes model training, evaluation, and inference code.

Run it locally:

python salary_predictor.py
